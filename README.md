# AirlineDatabaseSystem
â€¢	Built a database model for an Airline Management System to manage flights, seats, planes, staff and customer interactions. The project utilized MySQL for database management, PHP for backend functions, a web-based system for checking seat and flight availability and Firebase for an interactive support page for user and admin communication.
